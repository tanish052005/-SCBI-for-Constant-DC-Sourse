This project presents the simulation of a Switched-Capacitor Boost Inverter (SCBI) topology using MATLAB/Simulink, designed to operate efficiently from a constant DC source.
The model integrates the principles of both switched-capacitor (SC) circuits and inverter configurations to achieve a high voltage gain without the need for bulky magnetic components or multiple DC sources.
By using a reduced switch count, the circuit minimizes conduction and switching losses, improving overall efficiency and reliability.
The system effectively converts the constant DC input into a boosted multilevel AC output, making it highly suitable for renewable energy and low-power conversion applications.
Performance is analyzed in terms of voltage gain, output waveform quality, and component stress, highlighting the advantages of the SCBI topology for compact and cost-effective power conversion systems.
