# -SCBI-for-Constant-DC-Sourse
Simulates a Switched-Capacitor Boost Inverter (SCBI) topology in MATLAB/Simulink designed for conversion from a constant DC source to a boosted AC output. Demonstrates high voltage gain, reduced switch count, and improved efficiency suitable for renewable energy applications.
